# My-Code-Quiz

# # Module 4 Challenge


## Description
- In this challenge I created a quiz using JS.
- I have 5 questions with 4 option choices.
- I included a timer that counts down from 60.
- If the user chooses the wrong answer, it takes away 5 seconds.

The future of this project:
- In the future, I realize that my questions are no longer displaying.  I cannot figure out why?  I hope to fix this issue and then move on to the next obstacle of this challenge.  
- Future obstacles to fix:
    -Adding my styling (I will use bootstrap to increase my practice with it).
    -Incorporate the other functions (save my answer, post my score, save my intials)
